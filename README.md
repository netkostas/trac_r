Topographic Relief Alteration Calculator (TRAC)

The object of this work is to develop a code in R-environment, in order to estimate and quantify the change in terrain caused the relief of outdoor farms, according to "LETOPID methodology".

##Requirements

 * R
 * raster
 * SDMTools
 * maptools
 * scatterplot3d
 
##Usage
You can use `DoTRA.R` to calculate the Degree of Topographic Relief Alteration defined by the "LETOPID methodology". Also some plots are generated to visualize the given data and comprehend better the calculated results.
